Learning as well as reviewing common algorithms & data structures by implementing them in Java.

### Supplementary Books:
* Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), 3rd Edition, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
* Algorithms, 4th Edition, by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne
* Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition, by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell
* The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition, by Steven Skiena

### Online Resources:
* Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java, by Sarah Ettritch on Udemy <br>
* Algorithms, by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne on Coursera <br>
* Algorithms: Design and Analysis, by Tim Roughgarden on Stanford Lagunita <br>

### Tips & Tricks That I Follow:
* Day 1: Understand the ins & outs of a data structure or an algorithm from the theory side before looking at any code.
* Day 1: Write pseudocodes for them.
* Day 1: Think about different small test cases and experiment with them on paper or whiteboard. For example, if I am reviewing QuickSort, I would come up with a few short lists of numbers and sort them on whiteboard using the QuickSort concept.
* Day 2: Implement them the next day after you understand the theory behind the algorithms from Day 1. This helps me understand the concepts more than when I start implementing them right after on Day 1.
* Day 7: Review the concepts/theories and codes once a week, with a few days apart from each review session, until you are sick of it!

#### Note:
My focus here is on experimentations with the concepts and codes. It was simply meant to represent the concepts that I learned from the resources above.

Feel free to use any of the codes in this repo.
